# homeworks
The homeworks' I have done since the beginning of my bs
In the first homework we were required to implement a code that multiplies two theoretically infinite long numbers that a computer cannot represent. To do that I created an doubly linked list. It also does a base conversion and multiplies from base 2 to 10 accordingly to the input .txt file.

In the second homework we implemented AVL and Splay Tree's insertion methods, then compared their performance according to the rotation and check numbers.
Both homeworks have detailed reports inside as well.
Both written in C, use with a input file.
